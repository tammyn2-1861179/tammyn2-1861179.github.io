		<h2>Float Property</h2>
			<p>Level up bonuses are calculated on Sunday nights. Whatever you get in by noon on Saturday is guaranteed to get graded by the time the level-up XP is decided. I grade Writers on Wednesday night as well as Saturday nights. Builders (Class Exercise, Workshop) are due by the end of the day that we work on them in class, usually Wednesday. Builders(Original Work) are due by the end of the week at Saturday noon. I also grade periodically during the week, but no guarantees on when exactly that will be. If you have specific issues, let me know! If there is good reason, I can make exceptions. Keep in mind that you can have only one essay in for grading at a time so make sure to pace yourself!</p>
